Create and associate a fileref with an external file or an output device.

After creating the fileref, it can be used as an *alias* for the full path of the external file (For example
in the [infile](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-SAS/tree/master/programming/statements/infile), `file` or
`%include` statements/commands.

`filename` creates a fileref, `libname` creates a libref.
